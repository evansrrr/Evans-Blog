I don't know why but I decided to write this in English. Maybe it's I can't find a better way to control my expressions in Chinese. Using English is more compatible instead. 

OK, so this isn't a specific thread. It's more likely to be a casual journal. To remember, I actually haven't written any post since I complete these one or two blog website. Maybe because my mood. Sometimes men are used to under mood's control. So finally I decided to begin, it's already May(oh god), and I have lots of thing to share. I believe I will be excited to share, cause I'm that kind of person.

As I've considered one year ago, people live with Internet nowadays. But blog seems to be dwindling. People like compositions of more dimensions, like pictures and videos. And we are still seeking for more diving experiences, wearing VR glasses. The more dimension info an item carries, the less efforts it needs to be understood. We always like more straight feelings. Cinemas are more easy than galleries, galleries are more easy than libraries, right? 

But somehow I like the feeling of creating. Creating promotes thinking. When I write somethings, I should always check its reality and find my attitudes towards em. But I'll be passing facts even if it's a very subjective essay. And I plan to divide my posts into two categories, tech and life. Hope this will last for years. Alright this would be all. See u soon.
